# Image Classifier Project

## Structure of this repository 
In this repository, I have created two folders: part1 and part2, which outline the project structure. The part1 folder contains the file "Image Classifier Project.ipynb," which includes my code solution.
I have also tried to incorporate several additional files and folders that could be helpful. However, I believe the most important aspect here is the overall structure of my solution.
Similarly, the part2 folder includes my main work within the following files: "Image Classifier Project.ipynb," "train.py," and "predict.py," as these files contain my complete solution of my code .
