# Image Classifier Project

## Structure of this repository 
In this repository, I have created two folders: part1 and part2, which outline the project structure. The part1 folder contains the file "Image Classifier Project.ipynb," which includes my code solution.
I have also tried to incorporate several additional files and folders that could be helpful. However, I believe the most important aspect here is the overall structure of my solution.
Similarly, the part2 folder includes my main work within the following files: "Image Classifier Project.ipynb," "train.py," and "predict.py," as these files contain my complete solution of my code . 

## Notes on my work : 
in my work I stated the epochs to be 1 , earlier I set the epochs to 5 which took a great amount of GPU, I have trained it before on 5 epochs and it gave these outputs while training:Epoch 1/5.. Train loss: 5.180.. Validation loss: 1.998.. Validation accuracy: 0.527
Epoch 1/5.. Train loss: 2.209.. Validation loss: 1.108.. Validation accuracy: 0.703
Epoch 2/5.. Train loss: 0.681.. Validation loss: 0.819.. Validation accuracy: 0.782
Epoch 2/5.. Train loss: 1.528.. Validation loss: 0.719.. Validation accuracy: 0.809
Epoch 2/5.. Train loss: 1.459.. Validation loss: 0.648.. Validation accuracy: 0.828
Epoch 3/5.. Train loss: 1.137.. Validation loss: 0.617.. Validation accuracy: 0.823
Epoch 3/5.. Train loss: 1.268.. Validation loss: 0.591.. Validation accuracy: 0.841
Epoch 4/5.. Train loss: 0.359.. Validation loss: 0.526.. Validation accuracy: 0.848
Epoch 4/5.. Train loss: 1.289.. Validation loss: 0.508.. Validation accuracy: 0.860
Epoch 4/5.. Train loss: 1.257.. Validation loss: 0.477.. Validation accuracy: 0.875
Epoch 5/5.. Train loss: 0.820.. Validation loss: 0.457.. Validation accuracy: 0.885
Epoch 5/5.. Train loss: 1.156.. Validation loss: 0.430.. Validation accuracy: 0.884
